# About Me
My name is Jonathan Starke. My favorite animal is the Leatherback sea turtle. My ultimate goal is to reinforce knowledge and use around database creation and control.
## My Hobbies:
My current hobbies include music production, with the use of instruments and the formatting and editing of recorded files through software.
I am also into fossil collecting and working with aquariums.
## Websites I Recommend:
      - [Wikiversity](www.wikiversity.org) - Before my initial graduation of Wake Tech, I used Wikiversity to assist with my learning and acquisition of knowledge on a "budget".
      - [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org) - This website started my journey of coding out of High School, and was a great source to find the application development resources I could use.
